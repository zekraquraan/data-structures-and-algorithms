# Challenge Title
## array-insert-shift

## Whiteboard Process

[whiteboard](./wh22.png)
## Approach & Efficiency
## Insert and shift an array in middle at index
# Time Complexity
# O(n) because we loop n/2 times and when our input is large the performance will be similar to looping n times

# Space Complexity
# O(1) because regardless of the size of our input, the algorithm only allocates a constant number of variables

## Solution
# just run the following code [](./inser.py)
