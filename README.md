## Approach & Efficiency
# a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Solution

# To run the code, you can call the reverseArray() function with an array as its argument. This will return a new array with the elements in reversed order.

# For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], you can call reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4]) and it will return a new array [4, 3, 2, 1]. You can then use this new array as needed in your code.
