# Challenge Title
# Binary search in a sorted 1D array



## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

# a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

#  Big O :The binary search algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n represents the size of the input array. 
# the big O notation for the binary search algorithm is O(log n), indicating efficient search time as the size of the array increases.

## Solution
# RUN this code [](./binary_search.py)
